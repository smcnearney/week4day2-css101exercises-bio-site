                <p>Hello, my name is Stephen McNearney. I am a digital media producer specializing in front-end web development, audio engineering, and new media theory.
                I was born in Lawrence, Kansas and am based out of Atlanta, Georgia. I am one of five boys, and Godfather to an amazing young lady named Leda.
                In 2009, I earned a B.S. in Digital Media Studies from the Georgia Institute of Technology. Since then, I've been freelancing as a WordPress web designer, and have just enrolled in a coding bootcamp at DigitalCrafts here in Atlanta to become a full stack web developer and software engineer.
